description: Introduction to the bounce house.

The bounce house is an important part of stream.

In the bounce house you can find:

- profile picture orbs
- emotes
- various messages

Profile pictures and emotes live in the same space and bounce off of each other, damaging each others in the process.
When an orb/emote is hit by another, it shrinks and when small enough it eventually disappears.

## Profile pictures

You might have seen various profile pictures floating around in the bounce house.
You too, can join the fun by simply chatting.
Each time you chat your profile picture grows in size.
The profile picture will then continue to bounce around until it gets killed.

## Emotes

Emotes can also be found in the bounce house.
All emotes sent in chat will be spawned into the bounce house.
If an emote already exists, it will simply grow in size.

## Messages

The last part of the bounce house is the various messages floating around separately from the orbs.
These are user-submitted and appear in the color that you have selected in Twitch chat.
There is a limited number of messages in the bounce house.
Messages are put in a queue and each message is guaranteed to be in the bounce house for at least 10 minutes.
If new a message is added when the slots are full, it will be added to a queue and oldest message will be removed when their time expires.
Otherwise, messages stay indefinitely if the queue is empty.
