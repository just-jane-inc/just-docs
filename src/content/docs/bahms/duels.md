Ever wanted to duel another chatter?
Well you're in luck!
Simply **reply to a message** with the command `!duel` and bang it out.

Duels are a way to challenge another chatter to a shootout with their message at stake.
If the duelled person loses, their message is deleted.

Apart from deleting messages, the winner of a duel also receives a [giga-vip](/giga-vip) level.
(Note: giga-vip can only be won against people who have already won a duel in the past)

Duels appear at the top of the screen with both player's orbs starting at the center and moving apart in preparation to shoot.

### How to play

After a duel is started, music will play and when the music ends, both parties will be able to bang it out.

To shoot, type either `!bang`, `bang bang` or `!!`.

**Be mindful of stream delay.** Typically, Twitch streams can be delayed from 1 second up to 6 seconds or more.
Try and estimate your delay and account for it to have a better chance at winning.

**If you shoot too early**, you will be on cooldown for 3 seconds. 
Shooting within those 3 seconds resets the 3-second timer. 
You can see if you shot early by looking at your orb on screen. If you bounces up and down, you had missed a shot.

After the duel has been won, the timer will display the time it took for the winner to fire their shot, after the music ended.
            
### Other notes

Jill might bang you randomly... Get used to it.
