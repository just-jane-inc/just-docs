At the end of stream you can enjoy the credits scrolling by as we wait to be raided.

In the credits you can find:

- Executive producer

- Artists
- New followers
- Raids
- Pyramid schemers
- Special thanks
- Music
- Paid subscribers
    - All subscribers on a paid or prime subscription (not gifted)
- Sub gifters
    - Everyone who has gifted an active gifted sub

The credits source code is published [on our GitHub](https://github.com/just-jane-inc/just-roll-credits).
