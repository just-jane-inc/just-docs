There are a lot of sounds that can be played by typing certain words or phrases in chat.

Some sounds are free for anyone to use, while others require a one time payment of [Giga VIP](/giga-vip).

There is a special sound with a gigantified `justja211Zap` emote.

### Giga zap

Sending `justja211Zap` as [a gigantified emote](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/power-ups) will play zap sound at a much louder volume intended to startle
Jane.

## Paid Sounds

These are sounds that needs to be unlocked by paying a fee.

Currently, this is a one-time payment of [Giga VIP](/giga-vip), and you get to use the sound in perpetuity,
but this **might change in the future** depending on sounds use.
