# overview
Jane is doing her best but is probably not reading your messages as often as she should.
Using the Text-to-Speech (TTS) system gives you a way to cut through the spam and maybe even be heard.
Bless us with your wit using the `!tts` command.

## usage
The TTS is used with the following command `!tts [voice] <message>` where `[voice]` is optional.

```
# asrael using his signature catch phrase, selecting the sarah voice to represent his speech.
asrael_io: !tts [sarah] I'm a goon girl. Uwu. I deserve my huggies and kissies. Owo. Nya.

# jill choosing the olivia voice to be her new default
just__jillian: !my-voice olivia
```
## cost
The TTS costs money to operate and as such costs you a small amount of [gv](/giga-vip) to use.
There are generally no refunds for TTS if your message is moderated, however if there is an error you should be automatically refunded.

## filter
Please try to avoid being extremely vulgar with the TTS.
Remember that the stream should be PG-13.
Your messages do pass through a filter and some words may be replaced with \[FILTERED\].
